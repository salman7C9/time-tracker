# Time Tracker or Work Tracker

[![Build C# / .NET](https://github.com/salman7C9/work-tracker/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/salman7C9/work-tracker/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

## Goal

We want to be able to track our working hours.

We also want to get notified, if we are about to do overtime.

We want to have a summary or a day, week, or moth report.

We also want to be able to add a small comment to, what we have done and so for.

So we can see our progress and also our satisfaction with our work.


## Repository

To compile and run the project locally, do this:

```sh
cd ./WorkTracker
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Alternatively we are providing a wrapper you can use:
```sh
./run.sh
```
